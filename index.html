                    LearnMode is a capstone project to develop a web-based solution for the University of Puerto Rico: Mayagüez (UPRM) immunology laboratory. The project focuses on addressing the challenges faced by educators in performing Ouchterlony Double Diffusion experiments, which are sensitive to variables such as temperature and often yield undesirable results. The project aims to replace outdated methods such as chalkboard drawings by developing a user-friendly web application that allows for easy comparison of antigens and identification of reactions. LearnMode seeks to simplify and modernize educational materials, bridging the gap between software and non-software backgrounds to enable effective collaboration in educational technology projects.

                <p>
                    The project aims to address the need for an immunology diffusion simulation tool in the UPRM biology department while also addressing the need to modernize educational materials. Addressing these needs is crucial as it directly impacts students' education and professional careers in these programs. The proposed innovation is a web-based application that can perform basic immunodiffusion simulations integrated as a module within a more extensive web application. Users can create modules without software backgrounds, but the application facilitates collaboration between module designers and developers for more complex content, such as immunology simulations.

                <p>
                    <b>Proposed Solution: </b> The proposed solution is developing an application that provides basic immunodiffusion simulations for use in the immunology laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico: Mayagüez. The simulation will be integrated into a web application as a module and will be accompanied by module creation tools for individuals with non-software backgrounds. The application will foster collaboration between module designers and developers for more complex modules. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Gap with Existing Solution: </b> Using a chalkboard to teach immunodiffusion is outdated and lacks the hands-on experience required for students to grasp the concept entirely. Additionally, the previous computer simulation that was once available is no longer functional, leaving the biology department needing a reliable tool for conducting immunodiffusion simulations.

                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Value Proposition: </b> The solution's value proposition is to provide students with an interactive and engaging tool to learn about immunology diffusion, which will improve their overall understanding and performance in the subject. The module creation tools will also provide educators with an easy-to-use solution to modernize their educational material without investing significant time and effort.

                    The visual components of the simulation were styled to be very similar to the reference material that Dr. Acevedo utilizes in the laboratory. The simulator allows the user to select the antigens and antibodies in each location and visualize how they interact with each other.

                    The Learn Mode Platform will allow users with professor roles to see past modules they have created and allow them to create new ones. They will also be able to create a test and associate it with a specific module. They can also designate the test as "diagnostic," enabling them to compare the before and after results. As pictured above, the professor will also be able to view individual students' performance and statistics about the section in general.
